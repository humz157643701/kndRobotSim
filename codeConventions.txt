A consistent naming convention greatly improves the readability and maintainability of a program. ï¿¼
1.Class names begin with a capital letter: class Customer
2.Function names begin with a lowercase letter.
Although permitted by the compiler, periods, underscores, dashes, and funny characters should be avoided whenever possible (except where noted below).
3.Multi-word names have subsequent words capitalized: class FileTagger void getStudentInfo() for example.
4.Constants should be in CAPS.
5.Each class name should be a noun or a noun phrase: class LargeFurryMammal; for example.
6.Each function name should be a verb or a verb phrase: processBookOrder(); for example.
7.Each bool variable name should produce a reasonable approximation of a sentence when used in an if() statement: bool isQualified; for example. 
For data members, we use a common prefix. 
8.Member name: m_Color, m_Width (prepend lowercase m_)
9.static data members: sm_Singleton, sm_ObjCount 
For each attribute, we have naming conventions for their corresponding getters/setters. 
10.Non-boolean getters: color() or getColor()
   The latter is Java style, the former is Qt style. Both conventions are widely used. Try to be consistent in your code.
11.Boolean getters: isChecked() or isValid()
12.Setter: setColor(const Color& newColor);
